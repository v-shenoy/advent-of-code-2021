# :christmas_tree:advent-of-code-2021

## Overview

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2022 will be starting soon. In preparation for it, I decided to go back and solve problems from the previous 
iteration. This repository contains the solutions for the 2021 iteration. 

My language of choice for the year is Python. My goal is to write simple, readable, and idiomatic code as much as I can. I will also try to 
restrict myself to the standard library for the most part.

I have also tried to add some basic comments explaining the approach in each problem

## Solutions 

Each day's solution is in its own folder under `src`. Solutions for part A, B are independent and in their own files named `a.py` and `b.py` respectively.
Input for the day_XX is in the `XX.txt` file under the `inputs` directory.

**Running them is as simple as -**

```bash
$ python src/day_XX/a.py
$ python src/day_XX/b.py
# or run them all
$ bash run-all.sh
``` 

Or, if you have [just](https://github.com/casey/just) installed 

```bash
$ just run XX
```

> **Note:** You might require Python _v3.10.8_.
