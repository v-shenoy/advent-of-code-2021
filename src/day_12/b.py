# In this case, we are allowed to visit one of the lowercase nodes twice.
# There might be more elegant ways to do this, but I count the paths in two cases.
# Case 1 -
#   In the first case, each lowercase node can be visited at most once in a path.
#   This basically what we computed in the first problem, and I use the same function.
# Case 2 -
#   In this case, we designate one of the lowercase nodes as special (except start or end).
#   And we count the paths where this special node is visited exactly twice. We then
#   to this calculate for every non-terminal lowercase nodes and add them.
#
# Thus the total number of paths is given by
# p(every lower case node is visited at most once) + Î£vp(v is visited exactly twice; where v == lowercase, v != start, end)
#
# The reason I had couldn't have a single method where a non-terminal special lowercase node would be visited 0, 1, or 2 times is
# When we call this method while iterating over non-terminal lowercase nodes, we would overcount the paths where every node
# occurs at most once.
# 
# However, this does visit some paths multiple times while computing (we don't count them, but still), so it's not optimal.
