# We simply repeat the procedure for subsequent instructions
# In the final set of points, we find out the max x, y co-ords.
# Using this we print the grid [0, 0] x [x_max, y_max]
# If the point (x, y) is present in the final set, we print
# a "â–ˆ" (a block character) at the pos (x, y) else we print a " "
# This prints out a readable word which is the answer
